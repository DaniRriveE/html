        <p>From its opening sequence, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pratt">Chris Pratt's</a> Star-Lord dances through an abandoned alien vault on a distant planet to Come and Get Your Love, it was clear that Guardians of the Galaxy would bring something truly alien to the MCU. It was not a well known comic, but the film provided a much needed shot of humour and colour into a series that was in danger of becoming a little too serious following the events of The Winter Soldier. With a soundtrack of 70 and 80s bangers, and the charismatic Pratt at the helm of a band of entertaining misfits, it became an instant fan favourite.</p>

        <p><em>Taika Waititi's Thor</em> – as it shall be known in future cinephile circles – came close to the top spot because it is, quite simply, a masterpiece. A spacey, day-glo, genlol-a-minute masterpiece. Switching up the sometimes grating Marvel sass, and the not-quite working Thor formula, for something heaps more awkward and genuinely odd, Ragnarok is postmodern (but not in a wanky way) and by far the funniest Marvel movie to date. Cate Blanchett's villain Hela doesn't get the zingers, sure, but Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie is a drunken delight and well, then there's Jeff Goldblum. Every detail of the story, of Thor and Hulk's side mission and the defence of Asgard, has been meticulously put together in the manner of a trippy indie film, all the more impressive when you consider this is a huge Disney flick.</p>

        <h2>3. Black Panther</h2><h3><i>Year: 2018</i></h3>

        <p>With Black Panther, director Ryan Coogler broke the superhero film mold in many respects, elevating the genre in such a way that it managed to please both fans and critics – to the extent that it became the first superhero film to be nominated for an Academy Awards Best Picture gong earlier this year. <br> Basically, everything about this film is just great: the casting, the costumes, the plot, the performances. The setting of the secretly technologically-advanced nation of Wakanda is a true cinematic treat, and Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa is matched by an unusually three-dimensional villain in the form of Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, whose backstory gives pause for thought beyond a simple ‘good v. evil’ narrative. Add in multiple female characters who each have more substance than most superhero films’ entire casts put together, and Black Panther is the perfect example of how good a Marvel film can be.</p>
